# BitChannelsSteganography 2011

This is our college thesis project.

This hides an image file to 8 other images. 

The algorithm grabs the pixel channels (RGB) of the image and distribute this values to RGBs of the 8 other images.

This is uploaded to GitHub for portfolio purposes.


# Bit Channels Compromise Across Multiple Media (2011)
This repository contains our college thesis project, which focuses on an innovative technique for hiding an image file within eight other images.

### Project Overview
The core idea behind this project is to utilize the RGB pixel channels of an image and distribute these values across the RGB channels of eight other images. This technique ensures that the hidden image remains concealed within the host images.

###  How It Works
- Pixel Channel Extraction: The algorithm extracts the RGB values of the original image.
- Distribution: These RGB values are then distributed across the RGB channels of the eight host images, effectively embedding the original image within them.

### Purpose
This project has been uploaded to GitHub for portfolio purposes, showcasing our work and the skills we developed during our college thesis.
