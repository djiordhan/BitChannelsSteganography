# BitChannelsSteganography

Our thesis project in College 2011.

What it does, it hides an image file to 8 other images. The algorithm behind this is it grabs the RGB of the image to be hidden and distribute this value to RGBs of the 8 other images.

This is uploaded to GitHub for portfolio purposes.
